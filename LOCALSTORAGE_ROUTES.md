# Routes That Use localStorage (with Real Placeholder Data)

The app seeds **localStorage** with realistic placeholder data on first load so you can test every feature. Each route below uses at least one localStorage key.

---

## How to access this data on the website

1. **Start the app** (e.g. `npm start`) and open the site (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`). The seed runs automatically on first load.
2. **Pathfinder (volunteer) data:**
   - Open **Bookmarks**: go to **`/bookmarks`** (or use the sidebar: Volunteering → Bookmarks, or pathfinder nav). You’ll see 2 seeded bookmarks.
   - Open **Pathfinder profile**: go to **`/edit-new-profile`** to see/edit the seeded profile (Amina Okonkwo).
   - Open **Opportunity details**: go to **`/opportunity`** → click **Apply** on any row, or go to **`/bookmarks`** → **View Details** on a bookmark, or from the **Landing** page click **View Details** on a Featured Opportunity.
3. **Enabler data:**
   - Open **Enabler dashboard**: go to **`/enabler/dashboard`**. The “Your Opportunities” section shows the seeded opportunities.
   - Open **Opportunities posted**: go to **`/enabler/opportunities-posted`** to see all 5 seeded opportunities (view, delete, clear).
   - Open **Single opportunity**: go to **`/enabler/opportunity/opp-1`** (or `opp-2`, `opp-3`, `opp-4`, `opp-5`).
   - Open **Enabler profile**: go to **`/enabler/profile-setup`** to see/edit the seeded enabler profile.
   - Open **Pathfinder profile (enabler view)**: go to **`/enabler/pathfinder/1`** (or 2–5) to see bookmark toggle (pathfinders 1 and 2 are pre-bookmarked).
4. **Using the UI:** Use the **sidebar** (hamburger) and **nav links** on Landing, Pathfinder landing, and Enabler landing to reach these pages; all relevant buttons and links point to the routes below.

**To re-seed:** In DevTools → Application → Local Storage → clear all for your origin, then refresh the page.

## Pathfinder (Volunteer) Routes

| Route | What to test | localStorage keys |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|

## Quick Test Order

1. **Pathfinder flow:** `#/bookmarks` → see 2 bookmarks → View Details → toggle bookmark → back to `#/bookmarks`. Then `#/opportunity` → Apply → volunteer-details → bookmark. Then `#/edit-new-profile` → see/edit seeded profile → Save.
2. **Enabler flow:** `#/enabler/dashboard` → Your Opportunities (up to 4) → View details. Then `#/enabler/opportunities-posted` → view/delete/clear. Then `#/create-opportunity` → post new → check dashboard and opportunities-posted. Then `#/enabler/pathfinder/1` → toggle bookmark.

All routes above use **localStorage only** (no backend). For login/signup and API-backed routes, see `ROUTES_API_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
